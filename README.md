**My DevOps Journey**
Introduction My journey into DevOps has been shaped by a strong interest in optimizing software development and deployment processes, enabling agile, scalable, and efficient operations. Through this path, I‚Äôve explored a variety of DevOps concepts and tools, focusing on creating streamlined, automated, and reliable workflows. This document outlines my learnings, contributions, and hands-on experience across various areas in DevOps.

**Blog Summaries**

**Introduction to Microservices in DevOps Summary:** In this blog, I introduced microservices as a scalable architectural style for software development, where applications are divided into small, independent services that communicate through APIs. I covered key benefits such as fault isolation, scalability, and independence, which make microservices an ideal match for DevOps. DevOps practices like CI/CD pipelines, containerization with Docker, and orchestration with Kubernetes align well with microservices, facilitating streamlined collaboration and faster releases. Challenges such as managing inter-service communication and ensuring monitoring and automation were also discussed.

**Getting Started with Pulumi and Kubernetes on Windows Summary:** This blog provides a step-by-step guide to setting up Pulumi, an infrastructure as code (IaC) platform, to manage Kubernetes resources on Windows. I discussed prerequisites such as Node.js and the Pulumi CLI, alongside a Kubernetes setup. Key highlights included initializing a Pulumi project, installing necessary packages, writing Kubernetes infrastructure code, and deploying resources. I also covered infrastructure lifecycle commands like pulumi preview, pulumi up, and pulumi destroy. Pulumi enables using familiar programming languages, making cloud infrastructure management simpler and more adaptable.
